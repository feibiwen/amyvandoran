# Amy Van Doran's Modern Love Club:  [Modern Love Club](http://modernloveclub.com/)

## About this project

Modern Love Club was my first major volunteer project that I undertook as a hobbyist developer.  You can read more on the background of the site [here](http://hereshannahs.info/amy.html).  I have been intermittently maintaining this site since its inception, both for content and for appearance upgrades.

##  What are future plans for this site?

Modern Love Club has a high level of technical debt currently, as everything is minified by hand.  This is a byproduct of my own learning process over the years, so the next obvious step is to optimize it for efficiency.

There is no plans for design uprgrades presently, outside of continuing to make the site better in terms of responsiveness.
